            <h1>Auxiliary Verbs</h1>

<p><strong>Helping verbs</strong>, also known as "auxiliary verbs," work alongside main verbs to create various verb tenses, forms, and voices.</p>

<h2>Modal Auxiliary Verbs:</h2>
<p>Modal auxiliary verbs express attitudes, possibilities, permissions, and more. They can also be combined with different tenses to convey nuanced meanings.</p>

<h3>"Can" and "Could":</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Express ability, permission, or possibility.</li>
  <li>Example: She can swim. Could you pass the salt?</li>
</ul>

<h3>"May" and "Might":</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Indicate possibility or permission.</li>
  <li>Example: You may join us. It might rain later.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"Must":</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conveys necessity or strong obligation.</li>
  <li>Example: I must finish my homework.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"Shall" and "Should":</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"Shall" is often used in offers or suggestions.</li>
  <li>"Should" expresses advice or recommendation.</li>
  <li>Example: Shall we go for a walk? You should see a doctor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"Will" and "Would":</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Indicate future actions or hypothetical situations.</li>
  <li>Example: He will arrive soon. If I had money, I would travel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modal Verbs with Tenses:</h3>

<h3>Present Modal:</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Past Modal:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Structure: Subject + past tense of the modal verb + base form of the main verb</li>
  <li>Example: They could swim when they were younger.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Modal:</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Example: He may come to the party on Saturday.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
