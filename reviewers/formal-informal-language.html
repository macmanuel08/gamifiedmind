            <h1>Formal and Informal Languages</h1>

<h2>Formal Language:</h2>
<p><em>When to Use:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Professional Settings:</strong> Job interviews, business meetings, academic papers.</li>
  <li><strong>Official Communications:</strong> Letters, emails to professors/employers, formal invitations.</li>
  <li><strong>Respectful or Dignified Situations:</strong> Speaking to elders, authorities, or in ceremonies.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Characteristics:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Polite and Respectful:</strong> Addressing people with titles (Mr., Mrs., Dr.) or using formal titles (Professor, Director).</li>
  <li><strong>Structured and Complete Sentences:</strong> Complete sentences with proper grammar and punctuation.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoidance of Contractions:</strong> Instead of "can't," use "cannot"; instead of "it's," use "it is."</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the use of contractions can sometimes be acceptable in formal writing, especially when they don't compromise the overall tone of professionalism. In the context of the given options, the sentence "<em>I'm sorry, but I am unable to attend the meeting tomorrow due to a prior commitment</em>" strikes a balance between formality and clarity. The presence of the contraction "<em>I'm</em>" is subtle and doesn't significantly diminish the formality of the expression. Additionally, the sentence maintains a polite and respectful tone, making it the most appropriate choice for a formal setting among the given options.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No Slang or Colloquialisms:</strong> Use standard language and avoid informal words or phrases.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Dear Professor Smith, I am writing to inquire about the upcoming seminar on environmental studies. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with more information regarding the schedule and required materials. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [Your Name]"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Informal Language:</h2>
<p><em>When to Use:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Casual Settings:</strong> Conversations with friends, family, peers.</li>
  <li><strong>Texting/Social Media:</strong> Chats, comments, informal emails to friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Informal Gatherings:</strong> Hanging out with friends, parties, casual outings.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Characteristics:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conversational Tone:</strong> Relaxed, friendly, and casual.</li>
  <li><strong>Use of Contractions:</strong> "Can't," "won't," "it's," etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Informal Pronouns:</strong> "You," "I," "we" without titles or formalities.</li>
  <li><strong>Slang and Colloquial Expressions:</strong> Everyday language used within a specific group or region.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Hey! What's up? I'm thinking of catching a movie later. Wanna join?"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tips for Using Both:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Know Your Audience:</strong> Understand the context and the people you're communicating with.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Flexible:</strong> Adapt your language based on the situation. Being too formal in a casual setting can create a barrier, and being too informal in a formal setting might seem disrespectful.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice:</strong> The more you practice, the better you'll become at identifying the right tone and language for different situations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Scenario Role-Playing:</strong> Create scenarios and practice conversations in both formal and informal settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Rewrite Practice:</strong> Take a formal paragraph and rewrite it in an informal style, and vice versa.</li>
  <li><strong>Observation Challenge:</strong> Observe conversations or written communications in different settings and identify whether they're formal or informal. Analyze the language used.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Understanding formal and informal language gives you the power to navigate various social and professional situations effectively. Balancing these two styles helps in communicating your ideas appropriately while being respectful and relatable to your audience.</p>
