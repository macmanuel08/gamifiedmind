            <h1>Parallel Structure</h1>  

<h2>What is Parallel Structure?</h2>
<p>Parallel structure involves using the same pattern of words or phrases in a series to create balance and clarity in your writing. When you have a list or a series of items in a sentence, making sure they follow the same grammatical structure can make your writing smoother and easier to understand.</p>

  <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
    <p><strong>Clarity:</strong> It helps readers understand your ideas more easily.<br>
    <strong>Conciseness:</strong> It streamlines your writing, making it more concise and effective.<br>
    <strong>Emphasis:</strong> It emphasizes the relationship between ideas.</p>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Non-Parallel Structure:</strong><br>
    "She likes hiking, swimming, and to ride bikes."</p>

  <p><strong>Parallel Structure:</strong><br>
    "She likes hiking, swimming, and biking."</p>

  <p><strong>Rules for Parallel Structure:</strong></p>
